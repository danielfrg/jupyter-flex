# Jupyter-flex: Easy interactive dashboards for Jupyter

Use Jupyter Notebooks to quickly create interactive dashboards.

- Use [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) to start a live Jupyter Kernel for fully dynamic applications
- Support for [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Flexible and easy to specify row and column-based layouts
- Use Markdown headers and Jupyter Notebook cell tags to define the dashboard
- Use [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create static reports with the same layout

Inspired by [Flex Dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).

## Installation

pip install jupyter-flex
